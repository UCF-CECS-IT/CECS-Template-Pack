# CM-Documentation-Templates

A set of project documentation templates for use in new projects by UCF CM.


## How to use these files

In this project, each set of available templates is split out into unique branches.  Templates are grouped by project type and purpose; e.g. `plugin-files`, `theme-wiki`.

### Creating a new wiki

Whenever you're starting a new project hosted on Github, you should set up a new project wiki to host documentation and usage information.  A project wiki is a series of markdown files (and, optionally, images) that live in their own separate repo.  You can pull the wiki repo down locally to make changes, or make edits within Github directly.

For more information on Github wikis, [check out their documentation here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/).

1. From your project repo in Github, click on the "Wiki" tab.

    If you haven't created any pages for this wiki yet (you see a welcome message with a "Create the first page" button), create a new "Home" page and save it.  Else, proceed to the next step.

2. Clone the repo **for the wiki** onto your machine:

    `git clone https://github.com/UCF/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git`

    You should also see the git clone information for the wiki in the wiki sidebar.  See [Github's documentation on cloning wikis locally](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally/#cloning-wikis-locally-to-your-computer) for more information.

3. `cd` into the newly-cloned wiki repo.
